# Snake-and-ladder

We have tried to make a ruby implemented and oriented program and make a snake and ladder game (single player) the ruby program uses (rand) operator to display digits from 1-6 and if any of the player lands on a snake or ladder its shown with a text message 
And when any one of the four player wins the game the game is automatically ended...
Game always shows random numbers and random player wins the game .We have used def function to define player ,dice and cells and also fixed position of snakes and ladders...
